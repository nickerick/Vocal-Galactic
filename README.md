# Vocal-Galactic
Java based space game created in 2021 K-State Hackathon. Originally used AssemblyAI API voice recognition to activate actions within the game. Access to AssemblyAI was only avaialble during hackathon so I converted the game into complete analog controls.

Here's a link to a mini demo: https://youtu.be/l8QWF_gRTzQ

(Hard to see power ups activated as well as respawn animation in the video. Also, this demo is of the analog version of the game, not voice recognition)

### Controls
Uses arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot, and numbers 1 - 3 to activate the respective power up.
Destroy golden asteroids to collect powerups.
