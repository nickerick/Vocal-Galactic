# Vocal-Galactic
Java based space game created in 2021 K-State Hackathon. Originally used AssemblyAI API voice recognition to activate actions within the game. Access to AssemblyAI was only avaialble during hackathon so I converted the game into complete analog controls.

Uses arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot, and numbers 1 - 3 to activate the respective power up.
Destroy golden asteroids to collect powerups.
